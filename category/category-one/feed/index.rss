										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is growing evidence that silver nanoparticles are effective in killing a wide variety of viruses.</p>
<p>Certainly more research is required but one common thread in all the current scientific literature is that small particle size is critical. This is interesting as most cite particles of 10 to 20 nanometers being effective. Imagine then the effectiveness index of Mesosilver with its consistent particle size of 0.65 of one nanometer.</p>
<p>Motivation is not an accident or something that someone else can give you &#8211; you are the only one with the power to motivate you. motivation cannot be an external force, it must come from within as the natural product of your desire to achieve something and your belief that you are capable to succeed at your goal. positive pleasure-oriented goals are much more powerful motivators than negative fear-based ones. Although each is successful separately, the right combination of both is the most powerful motivational force known to humankind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making a decision to do something &#8211; this is the first step. we all know that nothing moves until someone makes a decision. the first action is always in making the decision to proceed. this is a fundamental step, which most people overlook. without clarity, you send a very garbled message out to the Universe. we know that the Law of Attraction says that we will attract what we focus on, so if we don’t have clarity, we will attract confusion. The sad thing is the majority of people have no clue about what they truly want. They have no clarity. When asked the question, responses will be superficial at best, will be what someone else wants for them. Trying to go through life without clarity is similar to sailing a rudder-less ship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is truly amazing the damage that we, as parents, can inflict on our children. So why do we do it? For the most part, we don’t do it intentionally or with malice. In the majority of cases, the cause is a well-meaning but unskilled or un-thinking parent, who says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and the message sticks – as simple as that!</p>
