										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &#8216;Content here, content here&#8217;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for &#8216;lorem ipsum&#8217; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is growing evidence that silver nanoparticles are effective in killing a wide variety of viruses.</p>
<p>Certainly more research is required but one common thread in all the current scientific literature is that small particle size is critical. This is interesting as most cite particles of 10 to 20 nanometers being effective. Imagine then the effectiveness index of Mesosilver with its consistent particle size of 0.65 of one nanometer.</p>
<p>Motivation is not an accident or something that someone else can give you &#8211; you are the only one with the power to motivate you. motivation cannot be an external force, it must come from within as the natural product of your desire to achieve something and your belief that you are capable to succeed at your goal. positive pleasure-oriented goals are much more powerful motivators than negative fear-based ones. Although each is successful separately, the right combination of both is the most powerful motivational force known to humankind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Success isn’t really that difficult. there is a significant portion of the population here in North America, that actually want and need success to be hard! Why? so they then have a built-in excuse when things don’t go their way! pretty sad situation, to say the least. for those of you who are serious about having more, doing more, giving more and being more, success is achievable with some understanding of what to do, some discipline around planning and execution of those plans and belief that you can achieve your desires.</p>
<p>The first thing to remember about success is that it is a process -nothing more, nothing less. there is really no magic to it and it’s not reserved only for a select few people. as such, success really has nothing to do with luck, coincidence or fate. it really comes down to understanding the steps in the process and then executing on those steps One thing for certain though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making a decision to do something &#8211; this is the first step. we all know that nothing moves until someone makes a decision. the first action is always in making the decision to proceed. this is a fundamental step, which most people overlook. without clarity, you send a very garbled message out to the Universe. we know that the Law of Attraction says that we will attract what we focus on, so if we don’t have clarity, we will attract confusion. The sad thing is the majority of people have no clue about what they truly want. They have no clarity. When asked the question, responses will be superficial at best, will be what someone else wants for them. Trying to go through life without clarity is similar to sailing a rudder-less ship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is truly amazing the damage that we, as parents, can inflict on our children. So why do we do it? For the most part, we don’t do it intentionally or with malice. In the majority of cases, the cause is a well-meaning but unskilled or un-thinking parent, who says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and the message sticks – as simple as that!</p>
